# <Refacting Starter Code for Accessibility>

## Description
As an older person who sometimes struggles to navigate websites I want to create a website that maximizes accessibility to users visiting my site so that I can utilize the information on my site. I want to use the skills I have learned to format and update an HTML file with CSS properties to create a more accessible website. 

## Installation

There is no installation required. 

## Usage

The website created allows you to learn more about Horiseon Solutions by clicking on one of the headers or scrolling down to read more about Horiseon. 

## License

Please refer to the LICENSE in the repo.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
