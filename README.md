# <Refacting Starter Code for Accessibility>

## Description
As an older person who sometimes struggles to navigate websites I want to create a website that maximizes accessibility to users visiting my site so that I can utilize the information on my site. I want to use the skills I have learned to format and update an HTML file with CSS properties to create a more accessible website. 

## Installation

There is no installation required. You can access the webpage at https://elizabeth189.github.io/Challenge-1/

## Usage

The [website](https://elizabeth189.github.io/Challenge-1/) created allows you to learn more about Horiseon Solutions by clicking on one of the headers located on the R side of the page. ![Horiseon1](assets/images/Horiseon1.png)

You can also scroll down on the webpage to read about Horiseon. ![Horiseon2](assets/images/Horiseon2.png)

You can look through both the HTML and CSS files to view how accessible the website was made.
